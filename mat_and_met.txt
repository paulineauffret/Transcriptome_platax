Platax transcriptome assemby

A total of 6 P. orbicularis samples including gonads tissues (n=2, one male and one female), pronephros tissue  (n=1), tegument tissue (n=1), liver (n=1) and intestine (n=1) were used to build the multi-tissue reference transcriptome. Reads quality was assessed with FastQC v0.11.5 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Reads were assembled with Trinity v2.5.1 [REF] using default parameters including trimming with Trimmomatic v0.36 [REF].
The raw transcriptome was then processed in order to reduce redundancy. First, open-reading frames (ORFs) for each transcript were predicted using ‘LongOrfs’ function implemented in Transdecoder v5.3.0 [REF]. Only the transcripts containing an ORF of at least 100 amino acids were conserved. Then, only the most expressed isoform for each gene with a minimum mapping rate of 0.5 TPM was conserved. Illumina adapter were screened in the transcriptome using a blastN (version  2.6.0) approach and adapter list (http://omicsoft.com/downloads/ngs/contamination_list/v1.txt). Reads were then mapped back on the filtered reference transcriptome to evaluate individual mapping rate with BWA mem v0.7.15 [REF]. Assessment of the final transcriptome completeness was conducted with BUSCO v3.0.2 [REF] against the conserved single-copy Metazoan genes database (n=978). We added a final step to look for bacteria contamination by using blastN against the NCBI nt database (release 2018-08-27, 19:53). Transcripts having a hit on Bacteria (pvalue 1e-4) were discarded. The resulting transcriptome containing 40130 transcripts was then annotated using Trinotate pipeline version 3.1.1 (https://github.com/Trinotate/Trinotate.github.io) following standard procedure and parts of GAWN pipeline (version 0.3.2 by E. normandeau https://github.com/enormandeau/gawn/blob/master/README.md).
