[bio mol mat & met : voir avec Denis & Celine]

A total of 6 P. orbicularis individuals including gonads tissues (n=2, providing from one male and one female), pronephros tissue  (n=1), tegument tissue (n=1) [compléter : voir avec Denis) were used to build the multi-tissue reference transcriptome. Reads quality was assessed with FastQC v0.11.5 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Reads were assembled with Trinity v2.5.1  [ref] using default parameters and including trimming with Trimmomatic v0.36.
The raw transcriptome was then processed in order to reduce redundancy. First, open-reading frames (ORFs) for each transcript was predicted using ‘LongOrfs’ function implemented in Transdecoder v5.3.0 [ref]. Only the transcripts containing an ORF of at least 100 amino acids were conserved. Then, only the most expressed isoforms for each gene with a minimum mapping rate of 0.5 TPM was conserved. Finally, Illumina adapter were screened in the transcriptome using a blastN (version  2.6.0) approach and adapter list (http://omicsoft.com/downloads/ngs/contamination_list/v1.txt). Reads were then mapped back on the filtered reference transcriptome to evaluate individual mapping rate with BWA mem v0.7.15 [ref]. Assessment of the final transcriptome completeness was conducted with BUSCO v3.0.2 [REF] against the conserved single-copy Metazoan genes database (n=978).
